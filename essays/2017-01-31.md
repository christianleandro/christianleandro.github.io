I think that configuration management is an incredibly important and vital skill for every programmer. It allows you to accomplish many things, from having a history of your code that you can revert back to to easily collaborating on a project with other people. On this note, in the first ICS class that I ever took we had to complete a group project by the end of the semester. Since we were all beginners, we didn't use any sort of configuration management and would just email each other the project when we did significant work on it.
