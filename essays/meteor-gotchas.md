## Meteor

Over the past few weeks I've been learning how to use meteor in one of my Computer Science classes. For those that don't know, Meteor is a Javascript framework that combines both the front-end (part of web app that user sees and interacts with) and back-end (code behind-the-scenes that runs everything). Because of the fact that it does both of these things and there are so many things running behind-the-scenes, it can be quite difficult to learn, especially for beginners who haven't worked on many large projects.
