## Meteor Ups and Downs

In my [previous essay](https://christianleandro.github.io/essays/meteor-gotchas.html), I talked about how I've been learning Meteor, which is a Javascript web framework that combines both the front-end and back-end. Coding itself is very difficult, and having to code around a very complex and large framework compounds this even more. It takes time and effort to understand the framework and what it is capable of. Particularly, I've been having trouble getting a grip on the control flow of projects being built with meteor. Since Meteor is so powerful and complex, it is difficult to determine how all of the Javascript, HTML, and CSS are interacting with one another to produce the web app. It's easy enough to get one page up and running, but when you have many pages that need to connect to each and code that keeps everything in the background running properly it is easy to get lost and overwhelmed.
